## Installing Refine

It's really easy. Go to the [OpenRefine website](http://openrefine.org/download.html) and download the package that matches your operating system.

Download and extract the contents of the archive. Then navigate to the folder holding the files you just extracted. Click on openrefine.exe. 

OpenRefine then opens up a terminal window and begins setting up a mini little web server. Once it has finished, point your browser to either 127.0.0.1:3333 or localhost:3333. 

If it worked correctly, you should see something that looks like this.

OK, we're ready to import our data. 

Today we're going to be working with data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification. I worked on a few stories that used this data, including one illustrating Trump companies' use of guest worker programs.

The applicatinon process for the H2A and H2B process first requires firms to ask the DOL for permission to import workers. DOL approves or denies those applications. If the application is approved, DOL also approves the number of guest workers the company wants to bring in. The results of that step are in this dataset. 

*Important caveat: These numbers are not neccessarily the number of workers actually imported by the company. Think of it like a maximum.*
